                <h1>Lovebirds</h1>
                <p>
                    Lovebird is the common name for the genus <em>Agapornis</em>, a small group of parrots in the Old World parrot family Psittaculidae.
                    Of the nine species in the genus, all are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to Madagascar.
                    Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots' strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together.
                    Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses, and seeds. Some species are kept as pets, and several colored mutations have been selectively bred in aviculture.
                    The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years.

                    Lovebirds are 13–17 cm (5–7 in) in length, up to 24 cm in wingspan with 9 cm for a single wing and 40–60 g (1.5–2 oz) in weight.
                    They are among the smallest parrots, characterized by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak.
                    Wild-type lovebirds are mostly green with a variety of colors on their upper body, depending on the species.
                    The Fischer's lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the masked lovebird have a prominent white ring around their eyes.
                    Many color mutant varieties have been produced by selective breeding. As of 2019, there are 30 known plumage color variations among lovebirds, caused by pigments called psittacofulvins.
